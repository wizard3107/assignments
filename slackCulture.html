        <div>    <h2>Parental leave</h2>
        <p>A lot of us have families, of all sorts of shapes and sizes, and we welcome each new addition with generous parental leave and "bonding leave".</p>

        <div>    <h2>Happier weekdays</h2>
        <p>A culture light on meetings (or that's our aim, at least) with guest speakers and opportunities to get to know your team better through events like weekly catered lunches and breakfasts, Thursday Socials and game nights. But we don't stay in the office 24/7.</p>
